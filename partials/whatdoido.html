                                        Developers are problem solvers. The best problem solvers are those with the best understanding of the broadest set
                                        of problems. They have toolboxes that are packed with different solutions.  Different tools are advantageuous in different situations -- knowing what the tools can do, from experience, and knowing where to apply them is an invaluable skill.

                                        I don't like the phrase "jack of all trades", but it's probably the most accurate way to describe my skillset.  I don't want to stagnate with a single technology into my old age.  I also want to understand how the modern technology world works, which presses me into constantly evolving my skills.

                                        Too many times I've sat in rooms where developers evangelize their holy-grail toolset as the silver bullet to all problems.  So often it ends up driving projects off a cliff.  Be open minded -- explore what else is out there.

                                        I've been using a computer for as long as I can remember.  I remember logging into a BBS to download a patch for a game I was playing in 1992. It's just been a natural part of my life.

                                        In seventh grade, in the school library, a bunch of kids were playing with something that turned out to be BASIC. They could do things like type <code>PRINT "Hello World"</code> and the computer would do it. It intrigued me.  Around the same time, I really got into a form of online game called

                                        At twelve years old, I had started programming.  At first it was simple stuff -- a bot that would greet people when they entered a room.  But as I got into it, I started developing more and more complex stuff in the game scripting language (which is similar to LUA).  
                                        <br/>

                                        At one point, I ran my own game (coding it, hosting it, running it) which had over 1,000 registered players and 85 concurrent active users as a record.  I had coded a rather complex economy system in it, called GalacticEcon which other games then adopted.  Someone is <a href="http://mushcode.annelions.com/mushdepot/Economy/G-Econ2/" target="_blank">still hosting the code online</a>, for the curious.

                                        Scripting code eventually became "hardcode", or <b>C++</b>.  I was 13 or 14 when that started, and I was fortunate to have a number of online mentors who did code reviews and helped me out.  I learned sometime later that I was practicing design patterns and used parts of C++ that most of my classmates in university had never used.  It was my first real programming language -- what a way to start.

                                        In ~1999, I was a co-admnistrator at a site called SidGames.com - a large community website for fans of Sid Meier's games.  That was my first foray into web development.  I learned <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Javascript</b>...although it was nothing like it was today.  Most of the programming was done in <b>ColdFusion</b>, where was had our own forum software and content management system. On the side, I did hardware reviews for the site (mainly to get the free video cards!).

                                        In high school, I continued working on the website and MUSH games outside of school.  I enrolled in all of the computer programming courses I could, including Computer Science IB, but didn't find them to be a challenge.  I had already learned all of the contents (and then some) on my own. It wasn't until second year university that I started actually learning some new concepts and techniques.

                                        When large projects need to be completed, it's not enough to have a large toolbox.  Working with teams, both small and large, is a skill that's difficult to master.  I've been lucky enough to have been granted many opportunities to demonstrate my teamwork and leadership, and it has helped me immensely in my career.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        While at SMART Technologies, I was a technical lead for their flagship software program.  At one point, the team had over forty developers on it across four scrum teams in three timezones.  Coordinating all of the efforts of these people, in addition to ensuring product quality and timely delivery was a tremendous challenge -- but it provided me with ample experience.  It is important that your team like you, trust you, and be open to your feedback or criticisms and that is something I was able to accomplish.  Recently, I was promoted to Principal Software Developer to broaden my scope beyond just the Notebook product in recognition of my efforts in this area.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        I feel the vital components of a highly productive team are comradery, fun, and trust.  I bring this to every team I join through humour, antics, honesty, and good old-fashioned friendliness.  On the Notebook team, I introduced 'Pedro the Panda', a 42" stuffed Panda, as the team mascot.  I got him his own cube and ID badge and everything.  He attended our sprint demos, we dressed him up in cowboy gear, and we blame him for broken builds.  The team collectively uses him in pranks or other target practice for the Nerf gear we have.  I set up a few large Smartboards at the end of our cube where the team works together to collaborative one-up eachother in making humourous images and scenes in Notebook.  It's all these little things that make coming to work enjoyable, and really brings out the diverse personalities on every team.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>

                                        Honest, constructive feedback is the key to healthy work relationships.  It's a practice that takes experience to hone, as not everyone responds the same way, but when you know how to frame your feedback you can get remarkable results out of people.  This sounds a bit corny, but it's true.
