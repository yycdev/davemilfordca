                                        Developers are problem solvers. The best problem solvers are those with the best understanding of the broadest set
                                        of problems. They have toolboxes that are packed with different solutions.  Different tools are advantageuous in different situations -- knowing what the tools can do, from experience, and knowing where to apply them is an invaluable skill.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        I don't like the phrase "jack of all trades", but it's probably the most accurate way to describe my skillset.  I don't want to stagnate with a single technology into my old age.  I also want to understand how the modern technology world works, which presses me into constantly evolving my skills.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>

                                        Too many times I've sat in rooms where developers evangelize their holy-grail toolset as the silver bullet to all problems.  So often it ends up driving projects off a cliff.  Be open minded -- explore what else is out there.

                                        Music is a big part of my life.  Discovering new stuff, rediscovering the old stuff.  I'll spend a good 
                                        couple hours per day with music on, whether it's through my phone, in my car, at work, or on the couch with
                                        a vinyl playing.  (Yes, I have a small but growing vinyl collection -- you can blame my brother for introducing me to them). 
                                    </p>

                                        As a kid, I took piano lessons for a number of years.  I'm also a self-taught guitar player, though I'm not
                                        any good.  I play acoustic -- feels more proper unless I've actually got a band to play in.  There aren't enough
                                        hours in the day to dedicate time to becoming good at it, but it's something that's on my bucket list.

                                        I can get into most types of music, but I gravitate towards Alernative Rock and Indie Rock.

                                        I'm a <b>builder</b>: I always want to make something.  It's not enough to play games, I need to
                                        make them too.  It's also how I learn -- I'm a hands-on learner and I want to learn by making.
                                        That's where this website came from - I wanted to learn a bunch of new technologies. And
                                        I didn't want to read about it.  I wanted to learn by building.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>

                                        But sometimes I just want to relax, too.  I'm a video gamer (still own all the consoles - plus the PC). 
                                        My Steam game collection has 191 games in it, though I've probably only played 10% of them (Steam sales...). 
                                        I love strategy (Civilization) and Grand Strategy (Paradox games), but sometimes I just want to unwind with 
                                        some more mindless games - Diablo III, Halo, Team Fortress 2, etc.

                                        I took a photography course in high school, borrowing my dad's 1980s-era Canon SLR, and I loved it.
                                        When I graduated from university, I bought a Canon digital SLR and have been shooting with it since.

                                        Music is a big part of my life.  Discovering new stuff, rediscovering the old stuff.  I'll spend a good 
                                        couple hours per day with music on, whether it's through my phone, in my car, at work, or on the couch with
                                        a vinyl playing.  (Yes, I have a small but growing vinyl collection -- you can blame my brother for introducing me to them). 
                                    </p>

                                        As a kid, I took piano lessons for a number of years.  I'm also a self-taught guitar player, though I'm not
                                        any good.  I play acoustic -- feels more proper unless I've actually got a band to play in.  There aren't enough
                                        hours in the day to dedicate time to becoming good at it, but it's something that's on my bucket list.

                                        I can get into most types of music, but I gravitate towards Alernative Rock and Indie Rock.

                                        I live in Calgary, Alberta, Canada -- in the foothills of the rockies. I'm not an urbanite, though.
                                        I own a house in the quiet suburbs with my partner of over eleven years and our two cats.

                                        When I'm not at work or at home, I like to make use of the mountains.  I haven't done it as much as I'd like to lately, but that will change.  I love hiking and snowshoeing: the serenity and clean air of the mountains, and the quietness of solitude or the accompaniment of good friends. It's also a great excuse to take some photos!  I'm an amateur camper as well: I really enjoy being able to disconnect with the digital world and reconnect with the <em>other</em> world.
                                    </p>

                                        My brother got me into Scotch many years ago.  It took some experience to get into it as he did, but I'm glad I did.  I've been to numerous whiskey shows and have tried dozens of different Scotch and other whiskeys. I mostly have single-malts at home (Glenfarclas 17 &amp; Highland Park 12 are my favourite go-to drinks), but I've got nothing against the blended!  People may think I'm an alcoholic because I've got over a dozen bottles of single malts on my shelf at any given time.  I'm not, I promise! They last years!  I love variety.
