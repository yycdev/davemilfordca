                                        I built legos, watched Star Trek, owned all the game consoles, built computers, and 
                                        even programmed as a kid. Always had that fascination with how things worked. I wanted
                                        to learn how to do it all.
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p>
                                        I'm a <b>builder</b>: I always want to make something.  It's not enough to play games, I need to
                                        make them too.  It's also how I learn -- I'm a hands-on learner and I want to learn by making.
                                        That's where this website came from - I wanted to learn a bunch of new technologies. And
                                        I didn't want to read about it.  I wanted to learn by building.
                                    </p>

                                        But sometimes I just want to relax, too.  I'm a video gamer (still own all the consoles - plus the PC). 
                                        My Steam game collection has 191 games in it, though I've probably only played 10% of them (Steam sales...). 
                                        I love strategy (Civilization) and Grand Strategy (Paradox games), but sometimes I just want to unwind with 
                                        some more mindless games - Diablo III, Halo, Team Fortress 2, etc.

                                        When I graduated from university, I bought a Canon digital SLR and have been shooting with it since.

                                        Music is a big part of my life.  Discovering new stuff, rediscovering the old stuff.  I'll spend a good 
                                        couple hours per day with music on, whether it's through my phone, in my car, at work, or on the couch with
                                        a vinyl playing.  (Yes, I have a small but growing vinyl collection -- you can blame my brother for introducing me to them). 
                                    </p>
                                    <br/>

                                        As a kid, I took piano lessons for a number of years.  I'm also a self-taught guitar player, though I'm not
                                        any good.  I play acoustic -- feels more proper unless I've actually got a band to play in.  There aren't enough
                                        hours in the day to dedicate time to becoming good at it, but it's something that's on my bucket list.

                                        I can get into most types of music, but I gravitate towards Alernative Rock and Indie Rock.

                                        I live in Calgary, Alberta, Canada -- in the foothills of the rockies. I'm not an urbanite, though.
                                        I own a house in the quiet suburbs with my partner of over eleven years and our two cats.

                                        When I'm not at work or at home, I like to make use of the mountains.  I haven't done it as much as I'd like to lately, but that will change.  I love hiking and snowshoeing: the serenity and clean air of the mountains, and the quietness of solitude or the accompaniment of good friends. It's also a great excuse to take some photos!  I'm an amateur camper as well: I really enjoy being able to disconnect with the digital world and reconnect with the <em>other</em> world.

                                        My brother got me into Scotch many years ago.  It took some experience to get into it as he did, but I'm glad I did.  I've been to numerous whiskey shows and have tried dozens of different Scotch and other whiskeys. I mostly have single-malts at home (Glenfarclas 17 &amp; Highland Park 12 are my favourite go-to drinks), but I've got nothing against the blended!  People may think I'm an alcoholic because I've got over a dozen bottles of single malts on my shelf at any given time.  I'm not, I promise! They last years!  I love variety.
